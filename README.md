Originally got this idea from ilmango (see his peaceful series). Peaceful difficulty without hostile mob loot is too difficult, so this mod changes Easy difficulty to be a hybrid peaceful-easy difficulty, or "peasy mode".

## What It Does/How To

Keeps mobs from targeting you in Easy difficulty but still allows them to spawn naturally.

## Watch Out For

- Mobs can still damage you, e.g.: colliding with jumping slimes, mobs with thorns (guardians).
- Zombies will still attack villagers
- Wardens still apply darkness effects

## Issues

- (Believe this is 1.20.0 only) Zombie reinforcements in Normal/Hard may continue to attack the player even after switching to Easy. Can be fixed by cycling the difficulty once more.
